Getting Started
1) Press the "Upload Firmware Folder" button and navigate to the inner most folder where the firmware is stored and select "Open".
	Note: Make sure the folder only contains the intended version of the ETU_MCU# files. If the folder is selected correctly
	then you should see the file path for each of the firmware files.
2) If using the "Upload ... File" buttons, select the respective firmware files for MCU1 and MCU2 from the file directory.
	Note: MCU2 has two files, one is the flash (MCU2 Flash File) and one is the regular program (MCU2 File).
	PLEASE MAKE SURE TO MATCH THE FILE NAMES.
3) Once the correct files are selected, press either the Two or Single Programmer Update button. See the respective sections
for more details.
4) Prompts will appear throughout the programming to highlight the current processes. 
If an error occurs try restarting the whole process.

Single Programmer Firmware Update
Requirements: One MSP430 USB-Debug-Interface Programmer, Two USB connections
1) Plug both the board and the programmer into any avaliable USB port
2) When prompted please make required connections and power cycle the board but unplugging it and plugging it back in.
3) After making the connections, press the button in order to continue update process. 
4) Update should be complete as long as connections were made correctly.  

Two Programmer Firmware Update
Requirements: Two MSP430 USB-Debug-Interface Programmer, Acroname programmable USB
Acroname Connections
Port 0: Connect the board power source
Port 4: Connect MCU1 Programmer
Port 6: Connect MCU2 Programmer
1) Plug both the board and the programmers into the respective ports listed above.
2) Press "Start Two Programmer Firmware Update"
3) Update should complete automatically as long as connections were made correctly.  

Error Messages:
Error Connecting to the Acroname
There was a failure connecting to the programmable USB ports.
Solution: Power Cycle the acroname and restart the program.

Could Not Program MCU1
Something went wrong trying to connect to the MCU1 Programmer/microcontroller
Solution: Make sure programmer connections are made correctly and are in the right orientation. 
After checking, try power cycling and restarting the program. 

Could Not Flash MCU2
Something went wrong trying to connect to and flash MCU2.
Solution: Make sure connections are made correctly. Try power cycling and restarting the program. 
Note: There have been boards with bad MCU2 connections, this could also be a possibility. 
Check "log.txt" within the debug folder if using Visual Studios version. There will be an error log explaining
whether it could connect to the microcontroller. If it says "Unknown device" its likely that MCU2 is broken.

Could Not Program MCU2
Something went wrong with the connection to MCU2. 
Solution: Likely the connection became undone. Try reconnecting and restart the program.
